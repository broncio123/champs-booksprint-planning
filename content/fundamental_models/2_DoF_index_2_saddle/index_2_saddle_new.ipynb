The construction of a dividing surface for general index *k* saddles was given in {% cite collins:244105 --file reaction_dynamics.bib %}.  However, in this section we describe a ''global dividing surface'' that is associated with an index two saddle point and two index one saddle points. Such a structure was constructed in analyzing the isomerization dynamics of a buckled nanobeam in {% cite collins2012isomerization --file reaction_dynamics.bib %}. Intriguingly, a similar geometrical structure arose on the study of the so-called ''roaming phenomenon'' in {% cite Harding_et_al_2012 suits14 --file reaction_dynamics.bib %}. Consequently, this type of geometrical structure could be more widespread in reaction dynamics so we believe it may be useful to give an analytically tractable example of such a situation.\n", "\n", "As opposed to our linear examples above,  for the system to have multiple saddle points it must be  nonlinear.
